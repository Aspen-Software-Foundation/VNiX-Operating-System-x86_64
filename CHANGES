Version: 0.10-pre 

CHANGES since version dev-prototype:

- reorganized a LOT of things, mainly because i took inspiration from early linux versions, plus it looks better
- removed most of the flashy colors from the kernelspace shell - i do NOT need a headache at three in the morning
- added more klib stuff, mainly taken from early linux versions for simplicity and whatnot
- added more serial to drivers for verbose debugging, and added time-since-boot to the kernelspace shell as both a cmd and a timer to logs
- fixed calibration flaws in time/tsc implentations
- minor cleanups and bugfixes
- modified the LOG_INFO, LOG_WARN, and LOG_FATAL in log-info.c/.h to automatically print function, file, and line (yay)
- added safe memory practices to the log-info files just incase it tries to do anything sneaky and crash the kernel with it.
- added more verbose logging to the kernel (you can never go wrong with more verbose logging)
- added actual syscalls to the kernel (wohoo!) after much trial and error
- removed the malloc tests in the kernel, since they were a little impractical in my opinion
- tweaked the ring 0, 1, 2, and 3 seperation in the GDT, as it was a little off
